Implementations of random basic algorithms. 

Contains basic implementations of some basic algorithms using features of Java which are not even required for these implementations. Essentially, whatever you see in this repository maybe stupid and over the top. It may even be wrong, although the results are correct in tests made so far. There are tons of improvements that are yet to be made.

Also, bubble sort is simply the worst.
